This script is used to deinterlace and upscale a directory of video files of a wide variety of aspect ratios to cinema 4K H264 MP4 files in a separate directory. This was developed for a particular context within my library and may not be applicable to other contexts and is provided as is without warranty.

If you are working in a non-profit and/or cultural heritage context and would like to see further development, or would like an executable of this script, you can [contact me separately](https://utm.library.utoronto.ca/contact/magnus-berg).
